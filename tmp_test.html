        Dear Mike and Denny
    </p>

    <p class="summary">
        Letter of Engagement â€“
        Purchase of
        60 Binge St and 66 Catwalk Blv
            Properties
    </p>

    <p>
    Thank you for asking Evolution Lawyers Limited <strong>(Evolution)</strong> to act for
    you.
    We understand that you would like us to assist
    you
    with the
    purchase
    of the
        properties
    </p>


    <p>
     We would be happy to act for
     you
     in this matter.
     Please find <strong>attached</strong> a copy of our standard terms of engagement.  Any service we provide to
     you
     will be subject to those standard terms, as varied or added to by this letter of engagement (together, the <strong>Terms</strong>).
    </p>

    <p>
    Please confirm
    that you agree with the Terms by return email.  Evolution can commence work on the matter as soon as we receive that confirmation.
    </p>

    <h4>Your Matter</h4>
    <p>
    I will have overall responsibility for your matter.  I will be assisted by other lawyers as and when required.
    </p>

    <p>
    The fees for this matter will be charged and billed in accordance with the Terms.  Our standard fee estimate for a property
    purchase
    is
    $880
     plus GST and disbursements.
     This is, however, an indication only, and the fee may increase if additional attendances are required.
    </p>


    <p>
    Disbursements for a matter of this kind typically include Land Information New Zealand registration charges, which are $80 per instrument (for example discharge of a mortgage or transfer of a title), title searches, which are $5 per search, and our general office disbursement fee of $25.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will endeavor to inform you in advance if it appears as though our fee will exceed the estimate.
    </p>


    <p>
    We look forward to your acceptance of our Terms.  If you have any queries about our engagement, please contact me.
    </p>

    <p>
    Yours faithfully<br>
    <strong>Evolution Lawyers</strong>
