    <p>
     We would be happy to act for
     {{secondPersonPronoun this}}
     in this matter.
     Please find <strong>attached</strong> a copy of our standard terms of engagement.  Any service we provide to
     {{secondPersonPronoun this}}
     will be subject to those standard terms, as varied or added to by this letter of engagement (together, the <strong>Terms</strong>).

    <h4>Your Matter</h4>
    <p>
    I will have overall responsibility for your matter.  I will be assisted by other lawyers as and when required.
    </p>

    <p>
    The fees for this matter will be charged and billed in accordance with the Terms.  Our standard fee estimate for a property
    {{matterTypeString matterType}}

    {{estimatePrice matterType}}


     plus GST and disbursements.
     This is, however, an indication only, and the fee may increase if additional attendances are required.
    </p>


    <p>
    Disbursements for a matter of this kind typically include Land Information New Zealand registration charges, which are $80 per instrument (for example discharge of a mortgage or transfer of a title), title searches, which are $5 per search, and our general office disbursement fee of $25.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will endeavor to inform you in advance if it appears as though our fee will exceed the estimate.
